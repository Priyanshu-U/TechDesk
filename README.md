## Introduction

Welcome to the TechDesk - LLM Powered Recommendation System repository! This project aims to provide personalized and expert advice to users who are looking to purchase large-ticket items online, particularly focusing on electronics. The system utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques, including instructor XL for document embeddings and Google Flan XL or GPT-3.5 for conversational interactions.

## Project Overview

The TechDesk Recommendation System involves two key components:
- **Document Embedding**: Expert documents are processed using instructor XL to create meaningful embeddings. These embeddings are then stored in the FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index for efficient retrieval.
- **Conversational AI**: The system interacts with end users through Google Flan XL or GPT-3.5, leveraging the stored embeddings to provide personalized recommendations and expert advice in real-time.

## Motivation

The motivation behind the TechDesk project stemmed from the widespread hesitation among users to purchase high-value items online. The lack of confidence in making informed decisions hindered online sales growth. By offering personalized and expert advice through an AI-powered recommendation system, we aim to bridge this gap and empower users to make well-informed online purchasing decisions.

## Market Research

Our initial market research indicated that 62% of individuals were not confident in buying large ticket items online. To delve deeper, we conducted a user survey to understand the reasons behind this hesitation:

## User Survey

In our user survey:
- 91.1% of respondents expressed their willingness to make online purchases if provided with personalized and expert advice on demand.
- 70% of respondents who were interested in online buying had never purchased electronics online.

These findings underscored the potential for a recommendation system that could address users' concerns and provide expert guidance during their online shopping journey.
